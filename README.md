## Configuration Telenet multiple accounts

When you can't connect to your Telenet account it's possible that you have multiple accounts and you have to provide your account identifier.
You can find your identifier by opening your browser in incognito mode and login to your telenet TV environment.
After entering your credentials an account selection screen will popup:
![account selection](/images/Telenet%20DTV.png)

- Find the account with the option 'Digital Base Telenet TV2'
- Right click the radio button before that account and click inspect element
- In the source code find the value of the box. Usually starts with DTV
  ![Identifier code](/images/Telenet%20code.png)
- Use that code in the config of your telenet account in HA

## Service to change channel

```yaml
service: media_player.play_media
data:
  media_content_type: channel # 'channel' when media_content_id is channelnumber, 'app' when media_content_id is 'Netflix' or 'Videoland'
  media_content_id: "401" # Any channel number, 'Netflix' or 'Videoland'
target:
  entity_id: media_player.ziggo_beneden
```

## Custom services

This service can be called to start a recording. Note that this shows a pop-up on screen and confirmation is required.

```yaml
service: lghorizon.record
data:
  entity_id: media_player.ziggo_beneden
```

This service can be called to rewind or fast-forward.
